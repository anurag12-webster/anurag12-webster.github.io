# This is a Hidden Post

This post has `hidden: true` in its frontmatter, so it won't appear on the public site.

## How to Hide Posts

To hide any MDX post from your site, simply add `hidden: true` to the frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "Your post description"
author: "Your Name"
date: "2024-12-20"
categories: ["Category1", "Category2"]
thumbnail: "/your-image.jpg"
hidden: true  # This hides the post
---
```

## Use Cases

- Draft posts you're still working on
- Posts you want to keep private
- Test posts during development
- Archived content you don't want to delete

The post will still be accessible via direct URL if someone knows the slug, but it won't appear in:
- The blog listing page
- The recent posts section
- Any other public listings

To make it visible again, simply change `hidden: true` to `hidden: false` or remove the hidden field entirely.
