# Welcome to My Local Blog

This is a sample blog post written in **MDX format**. You can write your own blog posts here and they will appear alongside your Medium articles.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a powerful format that allows you to write JSX in your Markdown documents. This means you can:

- Write regular Markdown content
- Include React components
- Add interactive elements
- Use custom styling

## Features

Here are some features of this blog system:

1. **Hybrid Content**: Both Medium articles and local MDX posts
2. **Medium Integration**: Articles from Medium with proper attribution
3. **Local Posts**: Write your own content in MDX format
4. **Unified Experience**: All posts appear together in chronological order

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## Conclusion

This hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds - you can continue writing on Medium while also having the flexibility to write detailed technical posts directly on your website.

Happy blogging! ðŸš€
